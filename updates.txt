After beta testing.

- Added 3 missing coins. (50c, 20c, 10c of France V2) and 2025 coins

- Changed some wrong information about coins (All coins revised by beta testers with Leuchtturm album).

- Added names with flags for better UX since not everybody know the country name by just looking at the flag (Some beta testers were not from Europe and did not know many european flags by heart).

- Made mint marks settings true as default (most beta testers prefered mints turned on) Also when adding coins without going to having gone to settings yet, a lot thought the feature just did not exist until they went to settings.

- Value tab did not have the coins by scale of their real life size.

- Changed flag on joined coins from EU commemorative flag to specific Country version to improve UX. Some people thought it was hard to understand how to check the country of joined coins.

- Added more coin qualities for uncirculated collectors & an info dialog for it.
